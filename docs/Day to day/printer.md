# PaperCut Hives
We can print documents with the PaperCut Hive service whoch requires to create an account. This system will handle all your printing. PaperCut will guide you through the setup process, but here’s a quick overview:

## From your computer:
Once you’ve created your account, you’ll access the User Portal. Under the Home tab, you’ll see your Access Code. When you print something from your computer, you can use this code directly on the printer to view and release your print jobs.

Before printing, make sure you’ve downloaded the printer onto your computer. You can find the download link under “Set up my devices” in the portal. Once installed, the printer will appear in your list of available devices, and you can send your print jobs there.

## From your phone:
You can also print from your mobile device! Download the app (the link is also under “Set up my devices”) and connect it to your account. You’ll be able to print from both your computer and phone, view your print queue in the app, and adjust things like color, double-sided printing, and number of copies before hitting “Print release.”

For more detailed instructions, check the “How to print” section in the User Portal.

If something doesn’t work or you get stuck, don’t worry just reach out to someone from the THT team and they’ll help you out.
